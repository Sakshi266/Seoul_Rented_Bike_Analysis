# SEOUL_RENTED_BIKE_BOOKING
This Power BI project analyzes the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset, aiming to understand how environmental and seasonal factors influence the number of rented bikes.
The dashboard provides interactive insights into rental trends, weather conditions, seasonal variations, and working day impacts.
## 🔎 Project Overview

This project explores the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset using Power BI. The dashboard answers questions like:

When and where are bikes most used (hour/day/month/season)?

Which stations have the highest demand and which are underused?

How do weather and holidays affect usage?

What is the typical trip duration and how does it vary by user type?

The goal is to provide actionable insights for operations teams, city planners, and product managers.
